## Installing Ruby on the Raspberry Pi

We'll use RVM to fetch, build and install Ruby for us.  Just type:

    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

Then go and make a cup of tea, some dinner, and have a small nap (it takes about an hour)

## Running the sample

To run the sample, just type:

    ruby greeting.rb
